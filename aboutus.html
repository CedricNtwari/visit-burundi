          <h1>Burundi: The heart of Africa</h1>
          <p>The Republic of Burundi is situated in the Great Lakes region of East-Central Africa and shares borders with Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Tanzania. It covers an area of   10,745 square miles and is one of the smallest countries in Africa, with a population exceeding only 10 million (approximately half of whom are aged 14 or less).</p>

         <h2>A Journey to Independence</h2>
          <p>Burundi claimed independence from Belgium on July 1 1962, and the name of the country was legally changed from Ruanda-Urundi to Burundi. On September 18 of the same year, the state  also joined the United Nations. Since the country's independence in 1962, there have been two genocides in the country- the mass killings of Hutus by the Tutsi-dominated army in 1972  and the 1993 mass killings of Tutsis by the Hutu populace.</p>

          <h2>Lake Tanganyika</h2>
          <p>Burundi's beautiful natural landscape is the major source of its tourism. Among its many natural attractions is the second largest lake in the African continent, Lake Tanganyika, which covers a total area of 32,000km2. As the second largest fresh water reservoir and second deepest river in the world, with a depth of 1400m, Lake Tanganyika boasts an impressive biodiversity with a wide assortment of around 1300 different plant and animal species. While Tanganyika is certainly the largest body of water, there is a great multitude of wetlands in Burundi, which collectively account for an estimated 2,150km2 of the country's surface.</p>
          
          <p><b>Other major lakes and rivers include: </b></p>
          <p><b>Lake Victoria </b>is an important water source, which serves as a fork to the Kagera River.</p>
          <p><b>Lake Cohoha </b>covers an area of 7850 ha and it is one of the most attractive areas of cross-border  lakes with Yaranda beach, agricultural banks and papyrus. The lake is is originated from and runs into River Kanyaru that finally runs into Nile.</p>

          <p>The <b>Ruvubu River </b>rises in the north of Burundi, near the town of Kayanza and then does a southward arc through Burundi, being joined by the Ruvyironza River near Gitega. The waters gather from the most distant portion of the Nilebasin. After a stretch along the border, the Ruvubu crosses properly into Tanzania, before joining the Nyabarongo River on the Tanzania-Rwanda border near Rusumo Falls, to form the Kagera River.</p>
          
          <p>The <b>Ruvyironza (or Luvironza) River </b>is considered by some to be the most remote source of the Nile, the world's longest river. From Burundi, it flows into the Kagera River in Tanzania, and from there into Lake Victoria.
          
          <p>The <b>Nyabarongo </b>(or Nyawarungu) begins in Nyungwe Forest, at a location considered by some to be the most distant source of the Nile. From this source it follows a course up to the north-western part of the country, then down through the centre to the south-east, eventually forming the main tributary of the Kagera River, which flows into Lake Victoria.</p>
