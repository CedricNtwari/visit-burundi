### Suggested Improvements

#### 1. Enhance the "Experience Burundi" Section (Homepage)

**Issue**: The "Experience Burundi" section on the homepage offers a glimpse into the beauty of Burundi. However, to provide users with a more comprehensive experience, it would be beneficial to expand this section to include additional content such as hotels, restaurants, and tourist attractions. Implementing these additions would require the incorporation of JavaScript to dynamically load and display this information.

**Suggested Solution**: Integrate JavaScript to fetch and display data about hotels, restaurants, and popular tourist destinations in Burundi. This would not only enrich the user experience but also offer valuable information to potential visitors.

#### 2. Book now Form: Input Validation (Book Now Page)

**Issue**: Currently, on the Book Now page, the inputs field lacks validation. For example, Adding a pattern validation can enhance user experience and ensure that users provide valid phone numbers.

**Suggested Solution**: Use JavaScript to validate the inputs field.

## Codeanywhere Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Codeanywhere, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A button should appear to click: _Open Preview_ or _Open Browser_.

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Codeanywhere with no-cache, you can use this alias for `python3 -m http.server`.

`http_server`

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A button should appear to click: _Open Preview_ or _Open Browser_.

In Codeanywhere you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.
